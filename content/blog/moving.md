title: "Moving All Content Here - Consolidating"

For a while since I have had an interest in autonomous vehicles, I have been
writing my content accross various platforms. These include:

* [Medium](https://medium.com/@wilfredgithuka)
* [Githuka.com](https://githuka.com)
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/wilfredgithuka)

While this is good for diversification, its not good especially when making a
follow-up on progress, or when I want to check up on a previous code sinpet or photo.

Just too inefficient from my point of view.

Due to this I shall be moving all my content to here [autonomy](https:autonomy.githuka.com) so that I
can ensure streamlining of my work.

Links shall still remain active till December 2019.

Thanks,

Right to Repair :-)
