Term 2 of Udacityâ€™s Self Driving Car Nanodegree is all about Sensor Fusion, Localization, Control and the C++math behind all the topics. 
I cant wait. I love math and math loves me. Term 1 was quite challenging for me in terms to time management but for this second term am all in.

In this term I cant wait to dive deeper into the Extended Kalman Filter and the Kidnapped Vehicle which really sounds deeper. 
Also in this time I will do a better job of documenting and uploading all my projects is good standard format.
