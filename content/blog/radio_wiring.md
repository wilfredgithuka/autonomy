As I write this post the radio is out and the front panel looks like a mess.

A peek behind the radio system last week looked like an wiring graveyard. The place
was full of accumulated dust and used insulation tape everywhere. Unlabelled wires
everywhere and weak connections.

## Wiring

I spent today cleaning and re-doing the wiring and improving the overall appearance
of that place.

B+ and ACC connection wires.

I fnished and tidied up the connections, ready for mounting back the radio system. I however want
to extend the wires see how I can have the rado at the back of the car, since I only use it
in AUX mode.

## Radio System

The car came with a basic SONY Sound system with MP3, Android and CD Disk functionality. I opened up the
radio and removed the CD setion which made it very light. I think I shaved off 200grams. The left over space
can be used to hold a Raspberry pi or something close to this.

The radio runs off 12VDC and takes in 0.9A when in standby mode.
