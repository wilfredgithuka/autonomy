For a while now since I got this Nissan Note I have been toying aroud with the
idea of having a Carputer. A carputer is a car-computer which handles connetivity
of all devices in a car. Most are aftermarket and operate on a higher level
that than the ECU.

## Basic Requirements of a Carputer

* Computing device
* Screen
* Input method
* Power

### Computing Device

This is perhaps the most important. A fairly sized computer will do. For me I 
fished out an unused Acer laptop which was in a very good condition. Due to the
fact that am planning to have this in the car, I need to find a good casing for
it. I also found an old Zuku set top box, removed the internal motherboard and
to my suprise the laptop's motherboard fit inside snuggly. I just had to make
some small adjustments.

This Zuku set top box is made of sheet metal casing and a plastic front panel.

For the battery, I noticed that the batteries have an output of 11.1V 4.8aH. I plan
to open the battery cover, redesign the case and have the batteries on a different
compartment. I think the laptop can run on a 12V which will be much easier to build.

In this new casing which I hope to be done by the end of this week, I will find a
place at the back of the car, then run any wires to it. Its main functions shall be:

* Storage location for my car's peripheral devices.
* Single point access to any devices connected to it.
* Connectivity ie wifi, bluetooth serves.
* Internet source for the car.

### Screen

For the screen I alreay have my Lenovo tablet which runs Android. Support shall be
okay and I dont foresee any issues. 

### Input Method

For this I will still use the tablet which shall act as the inerraction point to the
computer. The carputer shall have SSH on so that I can use the touchscreen or an 
external bluetooth keyboard for this.

### Power

The carputers power requirements are as follows:

* Voltage: 11.1V (Battery) 
* Power: 12W
* Current: 4A

By building a separate power system, I hope to be able to meet these requirements well.
