My test car is Japanese and Japanese vehicles have ETC Toll Devices. These are devices mounted
on preety all Japanese cars so that when you pass a toll gate there is no need to stop, the
deice will be detected automatically by a sensor on the gate and payment will be done electronically.

But when the cars leave Japan, most of these devices are no-longer useful, like here in Kenya. They are
powerd by a 12V DC which comes from the battery and is turned on as soon as you turn the key to ACC.

After locating the device, I removed it and realised that I could use the 12V DC terminals for 
my other power projects. I will however have to find a way to reduce it to something like 5V but there
is a catch. There is a 1A current limiting fuse which means there is a limit from this new 'fountain'.
