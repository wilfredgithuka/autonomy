      <description>Today is a good day for science.
Yesterday I stayed up late selecting which microcontroller I will use for the car project.
Well, its not that I had a plethora of chips to choose from, but on my workshop lay two chips:
 ATmega328 STC15F2K60S2  ATMega328 Lets first look at the ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller more closely. It has the following features:
 8-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor core.</description>

      <description>For a while since I have had an interest in autonomous vehicles, I have been writing my content accross various platforms. These include:
 Medium Githuka.com Twitter  While this is good for diversification, its not good especially when making a follow-up on progress, or when I want to check up on a previous code sinpet or photo.
Just too inefficient from my point of view.
Due to this I shall be moving all my content to here autonomy so that I can ensure streamlining of my work.</description>

      <title>Nvtop - A Task Monitor For NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <link>https://autonomy.githuka.com/blog/nvtop/</link>

      <description>Nvtop is the htop for NVIDIA GPU&amp;rsquo;s. This tool is very handy especially when you need to check the stats of the GPU as you train your neural network.
Installation yay -S nvtop  For more info, check the project&amp;rsquo;s page on Github</description>

      <title>GPU Hardware Specs Manual</title>

      <description>I thought it be good to put the specs of my local GPU so that in future, any tests that I do I can use this as a reference.
Make: NVIDIA GTX 1050 This GPU is built using NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s Pascal architecture, a successor of Maxwell which was introduced in 2016.
The GPU&amp;rsquo;s base frequency is 1354 MHz; the GPU Boost rating jumps to 1455 MHz.
Like the 1050 Ti, GeForce GTX 1050 exposes 32 ROPs and the same 1 MB of L2.</description>

      <title>Learning Good Old C</title>

      <description>Autonomous vehicle systems is all about hardware interraction with software and the algorithims that go well with it. For this, to be a good technician/engineer one must master the relevant software and hardware tools that are required for this.
All through the Udacity&amp;rsquo;s course for Self Driving Cars the language that I used mostly was C++. I also used Python for mostly high level programming like Neural networks and Machine Learning.</description>

      <title>Udacity&#39;s Term 2 - Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control</title>

      <description>Term 2 of Udacity’s Self Driving Car Nanodegree is all about Sensor Fusion, Localization, Control and the C++math behind all the topics. I cant wait. I love math and math loves me. Term 1 was quite challenging for me in terms to time management but for this second term am all in.
In this term I cant wait to dive deeper into the Extended Kalman Filter and the Kidnapped Vehicle which really sounds deeper.</description>

      <title>Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree-Lets Do This</title>

      <description>So much desire ends up in accomplishment. After waiting, saving and prepping(coding) for sometime I am ready to start my journey into the world of Self Driving Cars at Udacity.
I have read reviews, gone through students’ blogs on the course, tried out some projects on my own, so now I get to get my feet wet in the course.
Self-driving cars represent one of the most significant advances in modern history.</description>

      <title>Time To Get Moving — My First Autonomous Car Project</title>

      <description>The Python study program is over, am so excited to get my hands working on something. Last year I got a Red Hammer H2 RC Car. This car is made in China 1:14 and runs on 5x1.5V .I want to learn how to make it drive itself. Am sure there are tutorials online but I wanna make my own version . Currently it is controlled by a remote and has good suspension kits installed.</description>
