      <p>GoodMorning, I hope this post finds you well, and I hope you had a great weekend.</p>

<p>This past weekend I have been busy wiring up the radio and moving it from the
dashboard to the back. I find it more practical since I don&rsquo;t interract with it
so much during driving, furthermore the front section is currently occupied by the
<a href="https://autonomy.githuka.com/blog/android_tablet/">tablet mod</a>.</p>

<p>The SONY radio has the following sets of inputs and outputs:</p>

<ul>
<li>+12V and +12V Battery and ACC power.</li>
<li>-ve Ground Connection.</li>
<li>4 pairs of speaker connection for the 4 speakers.</li>
<li>AUX cable port.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly I used an ethernet cable which had 4 pairs of wires for the speaker wires. Then
I ran this cable from the dashboard, below the seats until the back of the car. At the
back I terminated it at the SONY car radio system. After a continuity test, all was OK.</p>

<p><img src="/e11/termination2.jpg" alt="termination" /></p>

<p>Now for the power connections I got some good gauge wires which had proper insulation. Took
a pair connected them at the dashboard +12V and ACC terminals then ran them alongside the
ethernet cable to the back. Also terminated at the radio&rsquo;s connection. I had a challenge of
getting a good grounding terminal since the back is all plastic and getting access to the
car&rsquo;s metallic body was not easy. I resulted to running a wire down under to the spare wheel
then up to the radio&rsquo;s -Ve connection point.</p>

<p>Soon after finishing this setup, I realised that I will have a problem. Since the tab is
at the front which holds all the music, how will I connect to it? Is there a 2M long AUX
cable? I had thought of using bluetooth but thats for another day.</p>

<p>For testing purposes, I used my phone which I connected it at the back and the system was
working well. It worked so well even when using max volume.</p>

<p>However after switching on and off the car during yesterday&rsquo;s afternoon&rsquo;s commute the radio
system did not come ON. I checked the ground connection, it was sound. Then I realsed that
also the <a href="https://autonomy.githuka.com/blog/voltmeter/">Voltimeter</a> was not displaying anything.
Thats when I realised that I could have blown a fuse. All other systems is the car are working
well except this one supplied by the 12V terminal where I had hooked the voltimeter and radio system.</p>

<p>A blown fuse could mean so may things happened. Overvoltage and Shortcircuit are the most common
reasons. Tonight I hope to check up on the wiring, and solve this issue.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. Remember to keep your eyes on the road always.</p>
