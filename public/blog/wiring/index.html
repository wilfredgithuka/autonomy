      <p>After a whole week with no radio in my car, I have been busy trying to locate
the blown fuse for the audio unit. I suspect the problem could be far worse since
the side mirrors are no-longer working anymore.</p>
<p>I used the manual and therefore would recommend you first consult your users
manual before attempting any modifications to your car.</p>
<p>The Audio Unit is has 2 power inputs/outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery+ 12V</li>
<li>ACC +12V</li>
<li>GROUND</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="battery-12v">Battery +12V</h2>
<p>This wire is Light Green/Yellow in color and is connected to the vehicle&rsquo;s +12V terminal accross
a 15A Fuse Connection No:34. There is also present a 10A fuse before you reach the Audio
Unit using harness number: E101-M1. This 10A fuse is actually mounted on the radio itself.</p>
<p>The connection is as follows: BATTERY -&gt; 15A FUSE -&gt; 10A FUSE -&gt;AUDIO UNIT</p>
<p>Note however that this +12V Line is connected directly from the battery through 2 virgin
control units *1A and *2B which have never been energised before on-board. This is the
same line which I hooked my voltimeter project.</p>
<p>The fuse for this line is located in the Fuseable link box right next to the battery. See the image below:</p>
<p><img src="/circuit/fuseable.jpg" alt="fusable"></p>
<p>The cover for this fuseable link box has a map on which fuse controls what. Look at this carefully well.</p>
<h2 id="acc-">ACC +</h2>
<p>This line is Blue and goes through Fuse Block(J/B) on M7 cable harness. The connection number is 16
and is protected by a 16A fuse. The connection point on the Audio unit is 37 but this might
change depending on the audio unit used.</p>
<p>From the battery the connection is as follows: BATTERY -&gt; 80A FUSE -&gt; ACC RELAY COIL -&gt; 10A FUSE</p>
<p>Note that this 10A fuse is shared between the following devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignition Key</li>
<li>NATS - Nissan Antitheft System</li>
<li>Mirrors</li>
<li>Audio</li>
</ul>
<p>This image below is the Fusebox which is located below the steering wheel.</p>
<p><img src="/circuit/fuse_box.jpg" alt="fusebox"></p>
<p>Once again the cover for this fusebox shows a map of the fuses. I strongly suggest you read this
carefully before replacing the fuses.</p>
<p>Using a multimeter I noticed confirmed the fuses were indeed blown out and needed replacement. I also
tested the other fuses which were okay.</p>
<p>REMEMBER TO ALWAYS READ YOUR MANUAL</p>
